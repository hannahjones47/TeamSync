# TeamSync
💻 TeamSync is an application developed using C++ and Qt Creator that allows members of an Agile development team to track tasks.

👩‍💻 There is a graphical user interface, however the main focus of this project was to strengthen my OOP concepts such as cohesion and coupling. I implemented design patterns using a tiered approach to decouple database access, business logic and presentation layer.
